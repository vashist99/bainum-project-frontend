# Backend API URL
# This is the URL of your backend API server
# 
# For LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
#   - Leave this empty or unset to use Vite's proxy (configured in vite.config.js)
#   - The proxy will forward /api requests to http://localhost:5000
#
# For PRODUCTION (Vercel deployment):
#   - Set this to your backend URL (e.g., https://your-backend.onrender.com)
#   - Do NOT include a trailing slash
#   - Example: VITE_API_URL=https://bainum-project-backend.onrender.com
#
# Note: Vite requires environment variables to be prefixed with VITE_ to be accessible in the browser
